# knife-vrealize

[![Build status](https://badge.buildkite.com/613130c62661841d0bb8ffc6c151bc9727546a8056124c627f.svg?branch=master)](https://buildkite.com/chef-oss/chef-knife-vrealize-master-verify)
[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/knife-vrealize.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/knife-vrealize)

This is a Knife plugin that will allow you to interact with
VMware vRealize products, such as vRA and vRO, from Chef's Knife command.

Note: This version only support vRA 8.x. If you need to use this gem for vRA 7.x, try the 6.x version of this gem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'knife-vrealize'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install knife-vrealize

... or, even better, from within Chef Workstation:

    $ chef gem install knife-vrealize

## vRealize Automation (vRA)

### Configuration

In order to communicate with vRA, you must specify your user credentials. You can specify them in your knife.rb:

```ruby
knife[:vra_username] = 'myuser'
knife[:vra_password] = 'mypassword'
knife[:vra_base_url] = 'https://vra.corp.local'
knife[:vra_tenant]   = 'mytenant'
knife[:vra_disable_ssl_verify] = true # if you want to disable SSL checking.
```

... or you can supply them on the command-line:

```
knife vra command --vra-username myuser --vra-tenant mytenant ...
```

### Usage

#### knife vra catalog list

Lists catalog items that can be used to submit machine requests.
By default, it will list all catalog items that your user has permission to see. To limit it to only items entitled to a particular project, supply the `--project-id PROJECT_ID` and `--entitled` flags.

```
$ knife vra catalog list
Catalog ID                            Name                         Description                                                Source

```

#### knife vra server list

Lists all machine resources that your user has permission to see. The "Deployment ID" is needed for other commands, such as `knife vra server show` and `knife vra server destroy`

```
$ knife vra server list
Deployment ID                         Name                    Status                Owner       Description

```

#### knife vra server show DEPLOYMENT_ID

Displays additional information about an individual server, such as its IP addresses.

```
$ knife vra server show 72fd5478-15f1-4aca-aa9b-012e2fa2ef01
Deployment ID: 72fd5478-15f1-4aca-aa9b-012e2fa2ef01
Deployment Name: Test terraform errors
IP Address: 10.30.237.66
Status: SUCCESS
Owner Names: admin
```

#### knife vra server create CATALOG_ID (options)

Creates a server from a catalog blueprint. Find the catalog ID with the `knife vra catalog list` command. After the resource is created, knife will attempt to bootstrap it (install chef, run chef-client for the first time, etc.).

Each blueprint may require different parameters to successfully complete provisioning. See your vRA administrator with questions. We'll do our best to give you any helpful error messages from vRA if they're available to us.

Common parameters to specify are:

 * `--image-mapping`: The image mapping that needed for this deployment which specifies the OS image for the vm
 * `--flavor-mapping`: specifies the CPU count and RAM of a VM
 * `--project-id`: Project ID also needs to be passed.
 * `--name`: Can be used to specify the name of newly created deployment. This should be unique.
 * `--version`: Specify which version of the catalog should be used for this deployment. If left blank, the latest version will be used.
 * `--ssh-password`: if a linux host, the password to use during bootstrap
 * `--winrm-password`: if a windows host, the password to use during bootstrap
 * `--image-os-type`: windows/linux
 * `--bootstrap-protocol`: winrm/ssh
 * `--server-create-timeout`: increase this if your vRa environments takes more than 10 minutes to give you a server.
 * `--bootstrap-version`: use to tie to a specific chef version if your group is not current
 * `--extra_params`: a hash of other data to set on a catalog request, most notably custom properties. It should follow `key=type:value` format. eg: `--extra-param hardware-config=string:Micro`
 * `-N`: node-name of the chef node to create. The gem will automatically create a node name with prefix `vra-` if not specified

Most of these can be set in your `knife.rb` to simplify the command:
```ruby
knife[:vra_username] = 'your-username'
knife[:vra_password] = 'your-pass'
knife[:vra_base_url] = 'https://cloud.yourcompany.com'
knife[:vra_tenant]   = 'your-tenant-name'
knife[:vra_disable_ssl_verify] = true # if you want to disable SSL checking.
knife[:subtenant_id] = 'your-subtenant-ID'
knife[:cpus] = '2'
knife[:memory] = '4096'
knife[:server_create_timeout] = '1800'
knife[:bootstrap_version] = '12.18.31' # pinning to an older version
knife[:server_url] = chef_server_url
knife[:requested_for] = 'your-username'
knife[:winrm_user] = 'machine-account-name'
knife[:winrm_password] = 'machine-account-pass'
```


```

#### knife vra server delete DEPLOYMENT_ID

Deletes a deployment and associated resources from vRA. If you supply `--purge`, the server will also be removed from the Chef Server.

```
$ knife vra server delete 2e1f6632-1613-41d1-a07c-6137c9639609 --purge
Deployment ID: 2e1f6632-1613-41d1-a07c-6137c9639609

### Known Issue: Pagination

A bug in vRA v6 (as late as v6.2.1) causes resource/server lists to potentially return duplicate items and omit items in the returned data. This appears to be a bug in the pagination code in vRA and was initially discovered and discussed [in this GitHub issue](https://github.com/chef-partners/vmware-vra-gem/issues/10). `knife-vrealize` tries to work around this by setting a higher-than-normal page size of 200 items.  However, if you have more items in your returned data than this, you can attempt to work around this further by using:

```
--page-size NUMBER_OF_ITEMS_PER_PAGE
```


## vRealize Orchestrator (vRO)

### Configuration

In order to communicate with vRA, you must specify your user credentials. You can specify them in your knife.rb:

```ruby
knife[:vro_username] = 'myuser'
knife[:vro_password] = 'mypassword'
knife[:vro_base_url] = 'https://vra.corp.local:8281'
```

... or you can supply them on the command-line:

```
knife vro command --vro-username myuser ...
```

### Usage

### knife vro workflow execute

Executes a vRO workflow.  Requires the workflow name.  You may supply any input parameters, as well.

```
$ knife vro workflow execute "knife testing" key1=value1
Starting workflow execution...
Workflow execution 4028eece4effc046014f27da864d0187 started. Waiting for it to complete...
Workflow execution complete.

Output Parameters:
outkey1: some value (string)

Workflow Execution Log:
2015-08-13 09:17:57 -0700 info: cloudadmin: Workflow 'Knife Testing' has started
2015-08-13 09:17:58 -0700 info: cloudadmin: Workflow 'Knife Testing' has completed
```

If your workflow name is not unique in your vRO workflow list, you can specify
a specific workflow to use with `--vro-workflow-id ID`.  You can find the
workflow ID from within the vRO UI.  However, a workflow name is still required
by the API.
