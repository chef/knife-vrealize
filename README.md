# knife-vrealize

This is a work-in-progress Knife plugin that will allow you to interact with 
VMware vRealize products, such as vRA and vRO, from Chef's Knife command.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'knife-vrealize'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install knife-vrealize

... or, even better, from within Chef DK:

    $ chef gem install knife-vrealize
